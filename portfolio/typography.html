            <h3>About this piece</h3>
            <p>
                This is a typography I made for my ARTX 2060 - Photography for non Majors class at the University
                of Utah. A typography in photography is the practice of taking very similar photos
                and placing them next to each other, in order to bring out their subtle differences.
                I was warned, before starting this project, that many bad photographers use typographies
                as an excuse for bad photos, so I decided to make sure my photos stood on their own
                as well as together. I found an old laser diode from some broken electronics, and I started
                messing around with it. I quickly found that it created a beautiful and ominous effect
                when lighting objects in pitch black, so I ran with that. I built a custom black box to use
                as a background, cut the lights, grabbed my camera, and lit up some pill bottles with lasers.
                I chose pill bottles because they seemed to have the best results, glowing with intensity
                and causing a very strange fuzzy vision effect to the naked eye. It is a very personal piece
                because of this; It feels as if the number of pill bottles are a measure of my health. It does
                not comment at all on pharmaceutical companies or western medicine, as images of pill bottles
                often do. It is rather a vulnerable piece for me that proves I should not be ashamed of my
                disabilities.
