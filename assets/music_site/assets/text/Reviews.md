# *LP3* by Hippo Campus

Hippo campus has always been one of my favorite bands, and was the group that introduced me to the genre of Indie Rock. While they started out with the typical upbeat indie rock sound, their recent works combine traditional Indie rock with a darker tone and more experimental tracks. They are comprised of 

-   Jake Luppen (lead vocals/guitar), 
-   Nathan Stocker (lead guitar/vocals),  
-   Zach Sutton (bass/keyboard)
-   Whistler Isaiah Allen (drums/vocals)
-   DeCarlo Jackson (trumpet)

*LP3* is their newest LP, and they have come a long way since their beginnings in 2013. The album is a combination of optimism and regret, as the band grapples with the corrupting qualities of fame, and the pressure that comes along with it. Despite this, they complement more emotional tracks with upbeat love songs such as "Ride or Die". The overall LP is a must-listen, as it perfectly balances many emotional tracks into a beautiful package, best listened to as a complete LP.

# *Bambi*, by Hippo Campus

To get an introduction to Hippo Campus, see the previous review for *LP3*. Hippo Campus has been very influential in the formation of my music tastes, and I just had to include the namesake song from the Album that started it all for me. I had listened to other Hippo Campus albums such as the genius that is *Landmark*, but *Bambi* is where it fully clicked for me. The album gives off a very tense and anxious atmosphere and has this otherworldly quality to it all. It's a joy to get lost in and simply go with the flow as it takes you through its musical exploration.

# *Sunny* Boy by Ritt, Mommney

Seeing the tiny artist, titled with the mixed up name of an infamous Utah Senator, playing at the small Salt Lake venue Kilby Court, I did not imagine that he would blow up as much as he did. But I saw potential in the man behind the moniker, Jack Rutter, and was immediately hooked on early songs such as *Pollution/Disclaimer*. I was ecstatic when his debut album *Her and All of My Friends* landed in 2019, and after a cover of the song "Put Your Records On" by Corrine Bailey Rae, the long awaited second album, *Sunny Boy*, was released to the masses. An evolution of Ritt Mommney's music style that combines light rap elements with heavy autotune with a basic Indie rock background, *Sunny Boy* presents itself as a culmination of years of work. The album is brilliant, and, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, is a joy to listen from the first to last track as songs are designed to fade together in a cohesive manner.

# *When We Were Friends*, by The Backseat Lovers

While Hippo Campus introduced me to the idea of Indie Rock, The Backseat Lovers were the first band I found as a result of this new passion. I saw them first at Kilby Court, a small venue in Salt Lake, around 2017. At this point they did not have a full album, but merely a couple songs that they had gathered over a few years. The band consists of

-   Joshua Harmon (lead singer / guitarist / pianist)
-   Jonas Swanson (lead guitar, vocals, pianist)
-   KJ Ward (bass guitarist)
-   Juice Welch (drummer and background vocals)

The band got its start as Josh Harmon and Jonas Swanson met at an open mic in Provo after not getting on the list to play, they sat on a bench and played for each other. At that point, Jonas and Josh, who had already joined up with Juice, got together to form The Backseat Lovers. They compiled their early songs into an EP titled Elevator Days and released it in 2018. 

*When We Were Friends was* the first full album to come out of this group, and it is a brilliant display of their capabilities. Right out of the gate they have many fan favorites such as Kilby Girl, Pool House, and Davy Crochet. Their most treasured song, however, is titled "Sinking Ship", and comes from Josh's early days before the band. The song was brought up to date as it was released with *When We Were Friends*, and the band has made it a habit of ending live sets with the song.

# *Waiting to Spill*, by The Backseat Lovers

To see an introduction to The Backseat Lovers, see the previous review of *When We Were Friends*. 

Four years after the release of *When We Were Friends*, The Backseat Lovers have come out with their newest full album, *Waiting to Spill*. The album is a drastic departure from their earlier upbeat rock pieces, and moves into a more deliberate indie rock landscape. It is emotionally charged, and even sad at times, but knows when to pick up the pace into a burst of sound, with songs such as "Growing/Dying". They also have beautiful pieces that tell the story of anxiety mixed with hope, such as with the song "Words I Used". The song takes the tempo and volume down, and introduces piano and vocals by Jonas Swanson, who offers a beautiful performance.

Their tour for *Waiting to Spill*, starting out in their hometown of Salt Lake, sold out within minutes of going live. I would know, because within a minute of the tickets going live, I could not get a single one. That is, if I didn't want to pay double the price from a scalper. Seeing this demand, and the large number of tickets simply flipped on Ticket Master, The Backseat Lovers decided to add another show in Salt Lake, and emailed me giving me and everyone who was on the mailing list before the concert series exclusive access to tickets. Going to the show was an amazing experience; I have never seen a better crowd than the one at this Backseat Lovers concert. Maybe it was just the exclusive tickets given out to fans, but The Backseat Lovers know how to rile up a crowd. They started out with a beautiful live rendition of their new album, but when they finished and switched to hits from *When We Were Friends,* the crowd went absolutely insane. Songs such as Davy Crochet and Kilby Girl (Named after the titular venue Kilby Court that gave the band their start) made the crowd ecstatic. It didn't help that Josh and KJ suddenly kissed onstage during an intense rock out session. 

Long story short, *Waiting to Spill* is amazing, and The Backseat Lovers are amazing.*In Transit*, by Drusky

Drusky originates from Heber Valley, here in Utah. Their name being a portmanteau of Drunk and Husky. The group started in 2019 with some single releases, but the big release of their EP *(Hush Hush Secret Stuff)* was what put them on the map, containing hit songs like Tuck Finder (Let's see if you can figure out what that really means). The band is comprised of

-   Mia Hicken (lead vocals / guitar)
-   Casey Ball (guitar)

-   Eli Pratt (bass)

-   Stacie Fleischer (drums)

The band creates a soundscape combining a strong rendition of the typical indie rock sound, with powerful vocals from Mia Hicken. The band manages to feel fresh with every song, tweaking their formula and creating stories with engrossing lyrics.

Releasing in 2022, *In Transit* is the group's newest EP, and brings years of work. You can feel their evolved sound compared to their last full release in 2019, as they experiment with more wild ideas such as the almost ethereal interlude, "Bodies". The EP, although short at only 4 songs, is a good cohesive, and is a sign for great things to come.

# *Doomscroller*, by Bowling Shoes

Bowling shoes are one of those bands you randomly find while browsing Spotify. The algorithm, knowing my tastes especially well at the time, brought me to a small group with only a couple songs, such as the single "Portland". The band consists of

-   Jeremiah Bermel (vocals, guitar, synth)
-   Sam Nazaretian (vocals, bass guitar) 
-   Ben Walker (guitar, synth, percussion) 
-   Sean Thomas (drums)

 With my curiosity spiked, I kept them on my radar to see what they would come up with. I was not disappointed at the release of their first full album, *Larry*. The album contains some fantastic lyrics, such as the song "Forthebirds!" in which the lyrics speak of all the things that Jeremiah will do "for the birds". Another song "Paleontology" which speaks to the Jeremiah's inability to be a professor of paleontology due to a lack of ingenuity. As the lyrics would suggest, the album carries a very happy-go-lucky tone throughout. It's a fun romp all the way through.

Their second full length album, *Doomscroller*, dropped in 2021, and is a perfect follow up. Bringing up serious topics at some points, such as with the titular song "Doomscroller", which speaks of the dangers of a negative mindset brought about by the firm grip that social media has on the population today. Despite this, they still keep the tone upbeat with songs such as "Donut Phone". With this release, they show their immense talent at creating an interesting indie rock soundscape that feels quite full of the traditional indie instruments of guitar and drums, as well as tasteful use of synth sounds to fill in the gaps.*Emotional Creature*, by Beach Bunny

The indie pop hit Beach Bunny hardly needs an introduction at this point. Originating from Chicago and headed by Lili Trifilio, the band has become a smash hit bringing in just about 7 million monthly listeners on spotify, and are currently being promoted by Apple through promotional material for the iPhone 14 line of phones. The band is current comprised of Lili (lead vocals, guitar), and

-   Jon Alvaro (drums)
-   Anthony Vaccaro (bass guitar)

I first learned of the band around 2018 with their release of *Prom Queen*, and have been a fan ever since. They exhibit a fun indie pop sound that brings a smile to your face. It is not too complex, but through it's simplicity it brings accessibility. That's not to say that they can't make anything more complex than a basic pop song. The song "Rearview" from the album *Honeymoon*, comes to mind, starting out with a very simple guitar melody and quiet but strong lyrics from Lili. The song then blows up into a cacophony of sound at the end, bringing a satisfying finish deserving of the lyrics.

Their newest Album, *Emotional Creature*, does not change their formula drastically, but does start to show them moving out of their comfort zone. Songs have more complex melodies, and you can feel some experimentation through Lili's vocals. It is not a drastic change, but I look forward to their future concoctions. The album contains many fantastic songs, such as a personal favorite, "Weeds", whose upbeat tone and fun elements bring a smile to my face. That sentiment is a perfect way to describe Beach Bunny; They may not be the most complex band, such as The Backseat Lovers or Bowling Shoes, but they know how to make a good song that puts a smile on everyone's face, and I think that that's a great quality to have.

# *Head Space*, by The Mellowells

The now defunct band, The Mellowells, is a band that I discovered after their heyday in 2014-2016, but the two albums they released in that time have stood the test of time. The band offers up a more classic take on rock, that falls between the genres of indie and alternative rock. I have categorized it under indie, but honestly it could fit in alternative or simply rock as well. The band is comprised of

-   Jesse Barki (vocals, guitar)
-   John DiCocco (vocals, guitar)
-   Caden Myers (bass guitar, vocals)
-   Cory Paternoster (drums, vocals)

The band provides a unique sound that is punchy and in your face. They tell crazy stories in a very adamant manner, such as with the song "The Historical Truth", that speaks of a man who "digs a giant hole, to the other side of earth" after learning that he is adopted. While I'm disappointed that I missed them while they were active, I treasure the two albums they left in their wake.

# *Scott Pilgrim Original Soundtrack*

Possibly an unconventional choice, the classic film adaptation of the graphic novel series *Scott Pilgrim*, captures the essence of early indie rock bands in Toronto, Canada. The crucial part of this ambition, is the beautiful soundtrack, headlined by greats such as Beck and Broken Social Scene. Some of my favorite tracks include "We Are Sex Bob-Omb" which opens the movie with an intense bout of guitar and drums as the protagonist Scott Pilgrim's band is introduced. Another favorite, "Black Sheep", by Metric and Brie Larson, is a fantastic, punk inspired song, that has an enormous kick behind it. The star of the show, however, is Beck's "Ramona". "Ramona" paints an acoustic landscape that you can easily get lost in and just nearly drift away.

# *Kind of Blue*, by Miles Davis

I will admit that I am a recent newcomer to jazz as a whole, and may not have great insight into the genre. I do know, however, that *Kind of Blue* by Miles Davis kicks ass. The entire set brings you through an instrumental journey. This is the kind of music that I can fall into as I carefully search for each and every tiny detail put forth in the masterful works, or, if I need to put this in the background as I do other things, it creates a beautiful soundscape for any occasion.

# *Blue Train*, by John Coltrane

I was introduced to Jazz recently from an old CD that my father had in his collection. The recording *Blue Train*, by John Coltrane, introduced me to Instrumental Jazz as a whole and has opened my eyes to a brand-new genre. An upbeat set, this album brings immense complexity and has little variations and details that you notice every time you listen.

# *Shovel Knight OST*, by Jake Kaufman

Shovel Knight is a great 16 bit revival game put forth as the debut game from developer Yacht Club Games in 2014. The soundtrack to accompany the game brings back an era of Super Nintendo music that is a delight to the ears. Containing many upbeat tracks that make heavy use of chiptune and synth sounds, this soundtrack is an example of a master at work.

# *Katana Zero OST*

Based on the work of multiple artists, *Katana Zero's* soundtrack brings across a defiant electronic soundtrack. The game *Katana Zero* is about a senseless killer ninja in a bathrobe hired by the government, so what better music to go with it than synthwave? The soundtrack is upbeat at times, foreboding at others, but always carries a sense of purpose that drives the game forward. Artists LudoWic, Bill Kiley, Justin Stander, and Tunç Çakır go all out to create an amazing album/soundtrack.

# *Rubber Soul*, by The Beatles

The 1960s rock sensation The Beatles are a classic mainstay of rock, even 62 years later. There is no real way to describe their genius. Each song they make combines new ideas and instruments, meaning that there is no single style that you can pin them on, except the broad genre of "Rock", which they often stray from. For example, their song "Rocky Raccoon" from the album *The Beatles*, is a full-blown folk song that tells the tale of a raccoon getting in a shootout to "get his girl".

*Rubber Soul* is an album that carries a lot of heavy hitters, such as "Norwegian Wood", and "I'm looking through you". Some Beatles albums come padded with some songs that just didn't stick the landing, so while Rubber Soul may not contain all the biggest songs, it is one of the most consistently good albums that will provide a full experience.

# Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots, by The Flaming Lips

The Flaming Lips are quite the odd band. Gaining popularity in the 1990s through crazy lyrics and a strong psychedelic rock base, they have made many albums throughout their continuing career. There are many great albums that exemplify their amazing talent, such as *Soft Bulletin* or *At War With The Mystics*, but there is only one album that shaped my childhood. *Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots*, which released in 2002, a year before I was born, was the soundtrack to my childhood. I have heard the song named after the album that details Yoshimi's plight against the Pink Robots so many times, and yet it is still enjoyable to this day. It puts a smile on my face every time I hear it. A perfect combination of insane lyrics and psychedelic music, only for the song to be followed by "Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Part 2" in which the band just goes into a crazy "rock out" session filled with intense psychedelic rock and Yoshimi's apparent screams as she battles the Pink Robots. The whole album is an exercise in insanity, and I could recommend it higher.
