<h1 id='lp3-by-hippo-campus'><em>LP3</em> by Hippo Campus</h1>
<p>Hippo campus has always been one of my favorite bands, and was the group that introduced me to the genre of Indie
    Rock. While they started out with the typical upbeat indie rock sound, their recent works combine traditional Indie
    rock with a darker tone and more experimental tracks. They are comprised of </p>
<ul>
    <li>Jake Luppen (lead vocals/guitar),</li>
    <li>Nathan Stocker (lead guitar/vocals),</li>
    <li>Zach Sutton (bass/keyboard)</li>
    <li>Whistler Isaiah Allen (drums/vocals)</li>
    <li>DeCarlo Jackson (trumpet)</li>

</ul>
<p><em>LP3</em> is their newest LP, and they have come a long way since their beginnings in 2013. The album is a
    combination of optimism and regret, as the band grapples with the corrupting qualities of fame, and the pressure
    that comes along with it. Despite this, they complement more emotional tracks with upbeat love songs such as &quot;Ride
    or Die&quot;. The overall LP is a must-listen, as it perfectly balances many emotional tracks into a beautiful
    package, best listened to as a complete LP.</p>
<h1 id='bambi-by-hippo-campus'><em>Bambi</em>, by Hippo Campus</h1>
<p>To get an introduction to Hippo Campus, see the previous review for <em>LP3</em>. Hippo Campus has been very
    influential in the formation of my music tastes, and I just had to include the namesake song from the Album that
    started it all for me. I had listened to other Hippo Campus albums such as the genius that is <em>Landmark</em>, but
    <em>Bambi</em> is where it fully clicked for me. The album gives off a very tense and anxious atmosphere and has
    this otherworldly quality to it all. It&#39;s a joy to get lost in and simply go with the flow as it takes you
    through its musical exploration.</p>
<h1 id='sunny-boy-by-ritt-mommney'><em>Sunny</em> Boy by Ritt, Mommney</h1>
<p>Seeing the tiny artist, titled with the mixed up name of an infamous Utah Senator, playing at the small Salt Lake
    venue Kilby Court, I did not imagine that he would blow up as much as he did. But I saw potential in the man behind
    the moniker, Jack Rutter, and was immediately hooked on early songs such as <em>Pollution/Disclaimer</em>. I was
    ecstatic when his debut album <em>Her and All of My Friends</em> landed in 2019, and after a cover of the song
    &quot;Put Your Records On&quot; by Corrine Bailey Rae, the long awaited second album, <em>Sunny Boy</em>, was
    released to the masses. An evolution of Ritt Mommney&#39;s music style that combines light rap elements with heavy
    autotune with a basic Indie rock background, <em>Sunny Boy</em> presents itself as a culmination of years of work.
    The album is brilliant, and, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, is a joy to listen from the first to last
    track as songs are designed to fade together in a cohesive manner.</p>
<h1 id='when-we-were-friends-by-the-backseat-lovers'><em>When We Were Friends</em>, by The Backseat Lovers</h1>
<p>While Hippo Campus introduced me to the idea of Indie Rock, The Backseat Lovers were the first band I found as a
    result of this new passion. I saw them first at Kilby Court, a small venue in Salt Lake, around 2017. At this point
    they did not have a full album, but merely a couple songs that they had gathered over a few years. The band consists
    of</p>
<ul>
    <li>Joshua Harmon (lead singer / guitarist / pianist)</li>
    <li>Jonas Swanson (lead guitar, vocals, pianist)</li>
    <li>KJ Ward (bass guitarist)</li>
    <li>Juice Welch (drummer and background vocals)</li>

</ul>
<p>The band got its start as Josh Harmon and Jonas Swanson met at an open mic in Provo after not getting on the list to
    play, they sat on a bench and played for each other. At that point, Jonas and Josh, who had already joined up with
    Juice, got together to form The Backseat Lovers. They compiled their early songs into an EP titled Elevator Days and
    released it in 2018. </p>
<p><em>When We Were Friends was</em> the first full album to come out of this group, and it is a brilliant display of
    their capabilities. Right out of the gate they have many fan favorites such as Kilby Girl, Pool House, and Davy
    Crochet. Their most treasured song, however, is titled &quot;Sinking Ship&quot;, and comes from Josh&#39;s early
    days before the band. The song was brought up to date as it was released with <em>When We Were Friends</em>, and the
    band has made it a habit of ending live sets with the song.</p>
<h1 id='waiting-to-spill-by-the-backseat-lovers'><em>Waiting to Spill</em>, by The Backseat Lovers</h1>
<p>To see an introduction to The Backseat Lovers, see the previous review of <em>When We Were Friends</em>. </p>
<p>Four years after the release of <em>When We Were Friends</em>, The Backseat Lovers have come out with their newest
    full album, <em>Waiting to Spill</em>. The album is a drastic departure from their earlier upbeat rock pieces, and
    moves into a more deliberate indie rock landscape. It is emotionally charged, and even sad at times, but knows when
    to pick up the pace into a burst of sound, with songs such as &quot;Growing/Dying&quot;. They also have beautiful
    pieces that tell the story of anxiety mixed with hope, such as with the song &quot;Words I Used&quot;. The song
    takes the tempo and volume down, and introduces piano and vocals by Jonas Swanson, who offers a beautiful
    performance.</p>
<p>Their tour for <em>Waiting to Spill</em>, starting out in their hometown of Salt Lake, sold out within minutes of
    going live. I would know, because within a minute of the tickets going live, I could not get a single one. That is,
    if I didn&#39;t want to pay double the price from a scalper. Seeing this demand, and the large number of tickets
    simply flipped on Ticket Master, The Backseat Lovers decided to add another show in Salt Lake, and emailed me giving
    me and everyone who was on the mailing list before the concert series exclusive access to tickets. Going to the show
    was an amazing experience; I have never seen a better crowd than the one at this Backseat Lovers concert. Maybe it
    was just the exclusive tickets given out to fans, but The Backseat Lovers know how to rile up a crowd. They started
    out with a beautiful live rendition of their new album, but when they finished and switched to hits from <em>When We
        Were Friends,</em> the crowd went absolutely insane. Songs such as Davy Crochet and Kilby Girl (Named after the
    titular venue Kilby Court that gave the band their start) made the crowd ecstatic. It didn&#39;t help that Josh and
    KJ suddenly kissed onstage during an intense rock out session. </p>
<p>Long story short, <em>Waiting to Spill</em> is amazing, and The Backseat Lovers are amazing.<em>In Transit</em>, by
    Drusky</p>
<p>Drusky originates from Heber Valley, here in Utah. Their name being a portmanteau of Drunk and Husky. The group
    started in 2019 with some single releases, but the big release of their EP <em>(Hush Hush Secret Stuff)</em> was
    what put them on the map, containing hit songs like Tuck Finder (Let&#39;s see if you can figure out what that
    really means). The band is comprised of</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mia Hicken (lead vocals / guitar)</li>
    <li>Casey Ball (guitar)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Eli Pratt (bass)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Stacie Fleischer (drums)</li>

</ul>
<p>The band creates a soundscape combining a strong rendition of the typical indie rock sound, with powerful vocals from
    Mia Hicken. The band manages to feel fresh with every song, tweaking their formula and creating stories with
    engrossing lyrics.</p>
<p>Releasing in 2022, <em>In Transit</em> is the group&#39;s newest EP, and brings years of work. You can feel their
    evolved sound compared to their last full release in 2019, as they experiment with more wild ideas such as the
    almost ethereal interlude, &quot;Bodies&quot;. The EP, although short at only 4 songs, is a good cohesive, and is a
    sign for great things to come.</p>
<h1 id='doomscroller-by-bowling-shoes'><em>Doomscroller</em>, by Bowling Shoes</h1>
<p>Bowling shoes are one of those bands you randomly find while browsing Spotify. The algorithm, knowing my tastes
    especially well at the time, brought me to a small group with only a couple songs, such as the single &quot;Portland&quot;.
    The band consists of</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jeremiah Bermel (vocals, guitar, synth)</li>
    <li>Sam Nazaretian (vocals, bass guitar)</li>
    <li>Ben Walker (guitar, synth, percussion)</li>
    <li>Sean Thomas (drums)</li>

</ul>
<p> With my curiosity spiked, I kept them on my radar to see what they would come up with. I was not disappointed at the
    release of their first full album, <em>Larry</em>. The album contains some fantastic lyrics, such as the song &quot;Forthebirds!&quot;
    in which the lyrics speak of all the things that Jeremiah will do &quot;for the birds&quot;. Another song &quot;Paleontology&quot;
    which speaks to the Jeremiah&#39;s inability to be a professor of paleontology due to a lack of ingenuity. As the
    lyrics would suggest, the album carries a very happy-go-lucky tone throughout. It&#39;s a fun romp all the way
    through.</p>
<p>Their second full length album, <em>Doomscroller</em>, dropped in 2021, and is a perfect follow up. Bringing up
    serious topics at some points, such as with the titular song &quot;Doomscroller&quot;, which speaks of the dangers
    of a negative mindset brought about by the firm grip that social media has on the population today. Despite this,
    they still keep the tone upbeat with songs such as &quot;Donut Phone&quot;. With this release, they show their
    immense talent at creating an interesting indie rock soundscape that feels quite full of the traditional indie
    instruments of guitar and drums, as well as tasteful use of synth sounds to fill in the gaps.<em>Emotional
        Creature</em>, by Beach Bunny</p>
<p>The indie pop hit Beach Bunny hardly needs an introduction at this point. Originating from Chicago and headed by Lili
    Trifilio, the band has become a smash hit bringing in just about 7 million monthly listeners on spotify, and are
    currently being promoted by Apple through promotional material for the iPhone 14 line of phones. The band is current
    comprised of Lili (lead vocals, guitar), and</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jon Alvaro (drums)</li>
    <li>Anthony Vaccaro (bass guitar)</li>

</ul>
<p>I first learned of the band around 2018 with their release of <em>Prom Queen</em>, and have been a fan ever since.
    They exhibit a fun indie pop sound that brings a smile to your face. It is not too complex, but through it&#39;s
    simplicity it brings accessibility. That&#39;s not to say that they can&#39;t make anything more complex than a
    basic pop song. The song &quot;Rearview&quot; from the album <em>Honeymoon</em>, comes to mind, starting out with a
    very simple guitar melody and quiet but strong lyrics from Lili. The song then blows up into a cacophony of sound at
    the end, bringing a satisfying finish deserving of the lyrics.</p>
<p>Their newest Album, <em>Emotional Creature</em>, does not change their formula drastically, but does start to show
    them moving out of their comfort zone. Songs have more complex melodies, and you can feel some experimentation
    through Lili&#39;s vocals. It is not a drastic change, but I look forward to their future concoctions. The album
    contains many fantastic songs, such as a personal favorite, &quot;Weeds&quot;, whose upbeat tone and fun elements
    bring a smile to my face. That sentiment is a perfect way to describe Beach Bunny; They may not be the most complex
    band, such as The Backseat Lovers or Bowling Shoes, but they know how to make a good song that puts a smile on
    everyone&#39;s face, and I think that that&#39;s a great quality to have.</p>
<h1 id='head-space-by-the-mellowells'><em>Head Space</em>, by The Mellowells</h1>
<p>The now defunct band, The Mellowells, is a band that I discovered after their heyday in 2014-2016, but the two albums
    they released in that time have stood the test of time. The band offers up a more classic take on rock, that falls
    between the genres of indie and alternative rock. I have categorized it under indie, but honestly it could fit in
    alternative or simply rock as well. The band is comprised of</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jesse Barki (vocals, guitar)</li>
    <li>John DiCocco (vocals, guitar)</li>
    <li>Caden Myers (bass guitar, vocals)</li>
    <li>Cory Paternoster (drums, vocals)</li>

</ul>
<p>The band provides a unique sound that is punchy and in your face. They tell crazy stories in a very adamant manner,
    such as with the song &quot;The Historical Truth&quot;, that speaks of a man who &quot;digs a giant hole, to the
    other side of earth&quot; after learning that he is adopted. While I&#39;m disappointed that I missed them while
    they were active, I treasure the two albums they left in their wake.</p>
<h1 id='scott-pilgrim-original-soundtrack'><em>Scott Pilgrim Original Soundtrack</em></h1>
<p>Possibly an unconventional choice, the classic film adaptation of the graphic novel series <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>,
    captures the essence of early indie rock bands in Toronto, Canada. The crucial part of this ambition, is the
    beautiful soundtrack, headlined by greats such as Beck and Broken Social Scene. Some of my favorite tracks include
    &quot;We Are Sex Bob-Omb&quot; which opens the movie with an intense bout of guitar and drums as the protagonist
    Scott Pilgrim&#39;s band is introduced. Another favorite, &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, by Metric and Brie Larson, is a
    fantastic, punk inspired song, that has an enormous kick behind it. The star of the show, however, is Beck&#39;s
    &quot;Ramona&quot;. &quot;Ramona&quot; paints an acoustic landscape that you can easily get lost in and just nearly
    drift away.</p>
<h1 id='kind-of-blue-by-miles-davis'><em>Kind of Blue</em>, by Miles Davis</h1>
<p>I will admit that I am a recent newcomer to jazz as a whole, and may not have great insight into the genre. I do
    know, however, that <em>Kind of Blue</em> by Miles Davis kicks ass. The entire set brings you through an
    instrumental journey. This is the kind of music that I can fall into as I carefully search for each and every tiny
    detail put forth in the masterful works, or, if I need to put this in the background as I do other things, it
    creates a beautiful soundscape for any occasion.</p>
<h1 id='blue-train-by-john-coltrane'><em>Blue Train</em>, by John Coltrane</h1>
<p>I was introduced to Jazz recently from an old CD that my father had in his collection. The recording <em>Blue
    Train</em>, by John Coltrane, introduced me to Instrumental Jazz as a whole and has opened my eyes to a brand-new
    genre. An upbeat set, this album brings immense complexity and has little variations and details that you notice
    every time you listen.</p>
<h1 id='shovel-knight-ost-by-jake-kaufman'><em>Shovel Knight OST</em>, by Jake Kaufman</h1>
<p>Shovel Knight is a great 16 bit revival game put forth as the debut game from developer Yacht Club Games in 2014. The
    soundtrack to accompany the game brings back an era of Super Nintendo music that is a delight to the ears.
    Containing many upbeat tracks that make heavy use of chiptune and synth sounds, this soundtrack is an example of a
    master at work.</p>
<h1 id='katana-zero-ost'><em>Katana Zero OST</em></h1>
<p>Based on the work of multiple artists, <em>Katana Zero&#39;s</em> soundtrack brings across a defiant electronic
    soundtrack. The game <em>Katana Zero</em> is about a senseless killer ninja in a bathrobe hired by the government,
    so what better music to go with it than synthwave? The soundtrack is upbeat at times, foreboding at others, but
    always carries a sense of purpose that drives the game forward. Artists LudoWic, Bill Kiley, Justin Stander, and
    Tunç Çakır go all out to create an amazing album/soundtrack.</p>
<h1 id='rubber-soul-by-the-beatles'><em>Rubber Soul</em>, by The Beatles</h1>
<p>The 1960s rock sensation The Beatles are a classic mainstay of rock, even 62 years later. There is no real way to
    describe their genius. Each song they make combines new ideas and instruments, meaning that there is no single style
    that you can pin them on, except the broad genre of &quot;Rock&quot;, which they often stray from. For example,
    their song &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; from the album <em>The Beatles</em>, is a full-blown folk song that tells the
    tale of a raccoon getting in a shootout to &quot;get his girl&quot;.</p>
<p><em>Rubber Soul</em> is an album that carries a lot of heavy hitters, such as &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, and &quot;I&#39;m
    looking through you&quot;. Some Beatles albums come padded with some songs that just didn&#39;t stick the landing,
    so while Rubber Soul may not contain all the biggest songs, it is one of the most consistently good albums that will
    provide a full experience.</p>
<h1 id='yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots-by-the-flaming-lips'>Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots, by The Flaming Lips</h1>
<p>The Flaming Lips are quite the odd band. Gaining popularity in the 1990s through crazy lyrics and a strong
    psychedelic rock base, they have made many albums throughout their continuing career. There are many great albums
    that exemplify their amazing talent, such as <em>Soft Bulletin</em> or <em>At War With The Mystics</em>, but there
    is only one album that shaped my childhood. <em>Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots</em>, which released in 2002, a year
    before I was born, was the soundtrack to my childhood. I have heard the song named after the album that details
    Yoshimi&#39;s plight against the Pink Robots so many times, and yet it is still enjoyable to this day. It puts a
    smile on my face every time I hear it. A perfect combination of insane lyrics and psychedelic music, only for the
    song to be followed by &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Part 2&quot; in which the band just goes into a crazy
    &quot;rock out&quot; session filled with intense psychedelic rock and Yoshimi&#39;s apparent screams as she battles
    the Pink Robots. The whole album is an exercise in insanity, and I could recommend it higher.</p>
